### Slide 2: Understanding the Core – GeoBIM & Its Challenges

*   **GeoBIM Defined:** GeoBIM represents the convergence of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Building Information Modeling (BIM). It extends BIM's detailed building-centric approach to include geospatial context, enabling the analysis and management of built environments *within* a broader geographic framework.
*   **Key Benefits:** Enhanced asset management, improved infrastructure planning, resilient city development, streamlined permitting processes, and better emergency response.
*   **Current Challenges:** Data interoperability between GIS & BIM platforms is a major hurdle. Different data models, coordinate systems, semantics, and exchange formats create silos. Lack of standardized workflows & processes for integrating the two domains.  Limited support for 4D (time) and 5D (cost) BIM integration within a geospatial context.
