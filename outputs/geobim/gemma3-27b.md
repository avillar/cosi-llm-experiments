## Slide 2: The Core Challenge: Siloed Data

*   Geospatial Data (GIS) & Building Information Modeling (BIM) traditionally exist in separate ecosystems.
*   Lack of seamless interoperability hinders holistic analysis – urban planning, disaster response, asset management.
*   Data formats, semantics, and coordinate systems are often incompatible.
*   Manual data conversion is costly, error-prone, and unsustainable.

---

## Slide 3: The GeoBIM Vision: A Unified Approach

*   **Goal:** To establish a common framework for integrating BIM and GIS data.
*   **Key Principles:** Open standards, semantic alignment, data continuity.
*   **Benefits:** Improved decision-making, enhanced efficiency, innovative applications.
*   **OGC's Role:** Driving standardization, facilitating collaboration, promoting adoption.

---

## Slide 4: ACCORD Project: Foundations for Interoperability

*   Focused on digitizing the built environment and fusing geospatial and BIM data.
*   Developed semantic frameworks aligned with evolving sector needs (buildingSMART and OGC).
*   Emphasis on open data standards for findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data.

---

## Slide 5: Semantic Alignment - A Deep Dive

*   **Challenge:** BIM and GIS use different ontologies and vocabularies to describe similar concepts.
*   **ACCORD's Approach:** Mapping between BIM (IFC schema) and geospatial concepts (OGC standards).
*   **Key Areas:**  Property sets, classifications, coordinate reference systems.
*   **OGC Contribution:** Leveraging OGC schemas (e.g., CityGML) for shared semantic representation.

---

## Slide 6: IFC & CityGML – Bridging the Gap

[Image: Diagram illustrating the relationship between IFC, CityGML, and common concepts like buildings, geometry, properties.]

*   IFC (Industry Foundation Classes): Predominant BIM data model.
*   CityGML: OGC standard for representing 3D urban models.
*   Direct translation is often impractical. Semantic mapping & transformation are crucial.

---

## Slide 7: ACCORD's Data Modelling Approach

*   **Hybrid Modelling:** Combining aspects of both IFC and CityGML to leverage strengths.
*   **Level of Detail (LoD):** Adapting the level of detail based on the application.
*   **Aggregation and Simplification:** Managing data complexity for performance.

---

## Slide 8: Coordinate Reference System (CRS) Management

*   Critical for aligning geospatial and BIM data.
*   ACCORD addressed CRS transformations and ensuring data is accurately georeferenced.
*   OGC standards (EPSG, WKT) were central to this work.

---

## Slide 9:  Interface Design & Open Source Tools

*   ACCORD prioritized open-source tools and APIs for data exchange.
*   Leveraged OGC web services (WMS, WFS, WPS) for interoperability.
*   Facilitated data access and manipulation through standardized interfaces.

---

## Slide 10:  GeoBIM Integration Pathways – A Framework

[Image: Flowchart illustrating different pathways for GeoBIM integration (e.g., direct translation, semantic mapping, federated models).]

*   **Direct Translation:** Converting BIM data to geospatial formats (often limited).
*   **Semantic Mapping:**  Transforming data based on semantic relationships (most promising).
*   **Federated Models:**  Combining BIM and geospatial data in a unified environment.

---

## Slide 11:  Data Transformation & Validation Rules

*   ACCORD developed rules for automatically transforming BIM data into geospatial formats.
*   Validation checks to ensure data quality and consistency.
*   These rules can be adapted and refined by the OGC GeoBIM Working Group.

---

## Slide 12:  Lessons Learned: Challenges & Opportunities

*   **Data Complexity:** Managing large and complex BIM models remains a challenge.
*   **Semantic Ambiguity:**  Resolving differences in terminology and definitions.
